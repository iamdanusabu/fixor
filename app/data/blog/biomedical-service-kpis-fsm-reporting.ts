      <p>How healthy is your biomedical service business? <em>Really?</em></p>
      <br/>
      <p>If you're like many small and medium-sized service owners, you probably measure success by the bank balance at the end of the month and the number of angry client calls (hopefully low). But this is like flying a plane with no instruments. You're guessing, not managing.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>To truly grow, optimize, and prove your value, you must track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These aren't just fancy numbers; they are the vital signs of your business. The problem is, they are impossible to find if your operations are buried in spreadsheets, paper forms, and whiteboards.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Here are the 5 critical <strong>biomedical service KPIs</strong> you must track, and the <em>only</em> way to actually find them.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>1. First-Time Fix Rate (FTFR)</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The percentage of service jobs completed successfully on the first visit, with no follow-up (or "call-back") required.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the king of all service KPIs. A high FTFR is directly linked to high customer satisfaction, lower operational costs (less fuel, less wasted time), and better technician morale. A low FTFR is a sign of a problemâ€”likely poor dispatching (wrong tech), incorrect diagnosis, or bad van stock inventory.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>How to Find It:</strong> You must have a system that can link a new work order to a previous one for the same asset and problem. This is a nightmare to do manually. You need <strong>FSM reporting for medical</strong> assets that understands call-backs.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>2. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The average time your technician is "wrench-on" actively servicing a device, from the moment they start the job to the moment they close it.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is your core efficiency metric. It measures how effective your technicians are. If your MTTR for a specific device model is high, it could signal a need for better training, digital access to service manuals, or more organized parts.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>How to Find It:</strong> You need digital, timestamped work orders. A paper log where a tech writes "10am-12pm" is a guess. A true FSM tracks when the tech changes the job status from "Traveling" to "In-Progress" to "Completed."</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>3. Preventive Maintenance (PM) Completion Rate</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The percentage of scheduled PMs that were completed within the required service window (e.g., in the correct month or quarter).</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For a biomedical service, this KPI is about survival. It is <em>the</em> metric for both compliance and revenue. A low PM completion rate means you are non-compliant and leaving guaranteed money on the table. Your goal should be 99% or higher.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>How to Find It:</strong> You must have an automated PM scheduling engine. Trying to track thousands of asset PM deadlines on a spreadsheet or calendar is how things get missed. You need a system that auto-generates PM work orders and reports on what's done vs. what's due.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>4. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The average time a specific piece of equipment operates successfully before it breaks down again.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the KPI your customers care about most: <em>uptime</em>. Proving you've improved MTBF for their critical assets is your single greatest sales tool. It's also vital for your own business, helping you identify "lemon" assets that are draining your resources and are no longer profitable to service.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>How to Find It:</strong> This requires a complete, accurate, and accessible service history for every single serialized asset. You must be able to see every PM and every repair over that asset's entire life. This is impossible without a dedicated asset-centric FSM.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>5. Inventory Turn Rate (Van Stock)</h2>
      <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A measure of how many times you use or "turn over" your van stock inventory in a given year.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is a cash flow metric. Parts are expensive. If your turn rate is too low, it means you have thousands of dollars in parts sitting on vans, collecting dust and possibly expiring. If it's too high, it might mean you're running out of stock too often, destroying your First-Time Fix Rate.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>How to Find It:</strong> You need real-time, digital inventory management where parts are logged as they are received and automatically "consumed" when they are added to a work order.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Stop Guessing. Start Seeing.</h2>
      <p>Notice a theme? You cannot manage what you do not measure. And you cannot measure any of these critical KPIs using paper, spreadsheets, or a generic FSM that doesn't understand PM compliance or asset histories.</p>
