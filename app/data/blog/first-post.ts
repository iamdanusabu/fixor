      <p>When you set up your business, you do so because you have a great idea that will be a hit in your market, or there’s a problem to fix and you have the solution. But as a non-technical startup founder, with no development skills, making your dream a reality can be a whole lot harder.</p>

      <br/>
      <p>Typically, wireframes are a really basic sketch or image of what the end product might look or feel like. For example, if your team is going to make a website, then you can draw a wireframe and a picture of what the layout will be like (e.g. where are the ad banners, how many columns are there etc.)</p>
