      <p>You did it. You left your old job, started your own biomedical service company, and built a reputation for quality work. You have two or three technicians, a handful of loyal clients, and you're busy—<em>too</em> busy.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>You're stuck. You spend all your time dispatching techs from a whiteboard, cross-checking spreadsheets, and manually typing invoices. You know you could handle more clients, but you just don't have the time. You've hit the "SME ceiling."</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The hard truth is that the all-in-your-head system that got you to 3 techs will *never* get you to 10. To <strong>grow your biomedical service business</strong>, you don't need to work harder. You need to build a system. Here is the 5-step plan to do it.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Step 1: Standardize and Sell Profitable Services</h2>
      <p>Stop being a "break-fix" firefighter. You can't build a scalable business on unpredictable emergency calls. Your first step is to create a standardized set of services, focusing on Preventive Maintenance (PM) contracts.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>PM contracts are the engine of growth. They give you predictable, recurring revenue, allowing you to schedule work in efficient batches instead of zigzagging across town. This is the foundation you build on.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Step 2: Ditch the Spreadsheet (Your Real Bottleneck)</h2>
      <p>Your whiteboard, Google Calendar, and Excel spreadsheet are your real bottlenecks. This manual system is a black hole for your time. You are the only person who knows how it works, so you can't delegate, and you can't step away for even a day.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>To <strong>scale your FSM business</strong>, you must move all operations into a single Field Service Management (FSM) platform. Your scheduling, dispatching, inventory, asset history, and billing must live in one place. This is the "brain" of your new, scalable operation.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Step 3: Automate Your PMs and Your Billing</h2>
      <p>Once you have an FSM, your next step is automation. Manually tracking hundreds of PMs across dozens of clients is why you're stressed. Manually re-typing invoices is why your cash flow is slow.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>A true FSM platform like <strong>Bravio</strong> will automatically generate your PM work orders 30 or 60 days before they're due. It will then connect the completed digital service report directly to an invoice. This step alone frees up 50% of your admin time, allowing you to focus on finding new clients.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Step 4: Empower Your Techs with Mobile Tools</h2>
      <p>You can't be on every job site. To scale, you must trust your technicians. That trust is built on giving them the tools they need to be independent and efficient.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>A mobile FSM app allows your techs to see their schedule, pull up a device's full service history, fill out digital PM checklists, and log parts used—all from their tablet. They stop calling you for simple information and start closing jobs faster, with higher quality.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Step 5: Track Your KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)</h2>
      <p>You can't manage what you don't measure. How do you know if you're ready to hire a new tech? How do you know which clients are profitable and which are costing you money?</p>
      <br/>
      <p>An FSM platform gives you a real-time dashboard. You can finally track critical growth metrics like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First-Time Fix Rate:</strong> Are your techs solving problems on the first visit?</li>
        <li><strong>Technician Utilization:</strong> How much of your techs' day is spent on billable work vs. driving?</li>
        <li><strong>Invoice Aging:</strong> How quickly are you getting paid?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These numbers tell you the health of your business and when it's time to grow.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>From Technician to CEO</h2>
      <p>Scaling your business is a journey from being your company's best technician to being its leader. That transition is only possible by building a reliable system that can run without you doing everything.</p>
      <br/>
