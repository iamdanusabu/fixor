    <p>If you run a small or medium-sized biomedical equipment service company, you know your job is unique. You're not just fixing an HVAC unit; you're maintaining life-saving devices. The stakes are infinitely higher.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>So, you decided to digitize. You signed up for a generic Field Service Management (FSM) software, hoping it would organize your techs, track your jobs, and simplify your billing. But now you're drowning in "custom fields," your techs are frustrated, and you're still doing compliance paperwork by hand. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>The truth is, <strong>generic FSM software fails for biomedical service</strong>. It's not built for your world. Here’s why.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <h2>1. The Compliance Nightmare (FDA, HIPAA & UDI)</h2>
    <p>Generic FSMs think "compliance" is a checkbox. For you, it's a non-negotiable part of every single action. Your customers—and the FDA—demand a complete, auditable service history for every device.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Generic tools can't handle this. They don't have built-in fields for <strong>Unique Device Identification (UDI)</strong>, risk levels, or preventive maintenance (PM) protocols based on OEM standards. When an auditor asks for the full service history of a specific infusion pump (serial number 12345), you're left scrambling through spreadsheets and "custom note" fields. A generic FSM simply cannot produce an audit-ready report.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <h2>2. The Inventory & Calibration Catastrophe</h2>
    <p>To a generic FSM, a "part" is just a SKU. To you, a part is a traceable component. You need to know not just that you used a new battery, but the <strong>lot number</strong> of that battery and its <strong>expiration date</strong>.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>What about your technician's tools? That same generic FSM has no way to track the <strong>calibration status of your tech's testing equipment</strong>. If your tech uses an uncalibrated multimeter to service a device, that entire service record is invalid. Generic software has no concept of this "nested" compliance—it's a critical failure point.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>3. The Flawed "First-Available" Scheduling</h2>
    <p>Generic FSMs are built on one simple rule: get the closest tech to the job. This works for plumbing. It's dangerous for biomedical service.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Your scheduling is complex. It depends on:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Criticality:</strong> A broken defibrillator in the ER takes priority over a routine PM on a vitals monitor.</li>
      <li><strong>Technician Skill:</strong> You can't send your new Level 1 tech to service a complex MRI machine.</li>
      <li><strong>Parts:</strong> Does the tech have the required (and calibrated) parts in their van stock?</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h2>Stop Fighting Your Software. Get the Right Tool.</h2>
    <p>You don't need <em>more</em> features; you need the <em>right</em> features. You need a tool that speaks your language: UDI, PM protocols, part traceability, and skill-based dispatching.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>This is why we built <strong>Bravio</strong>. It's the first FSM platform designed *exclusively* for small and medium-sized biomedical service companies. We handle the complex compliance and inventory tracking out-of-the-box, so you can stop fighting your software and focus on growing your business.</p>
    <br/>
