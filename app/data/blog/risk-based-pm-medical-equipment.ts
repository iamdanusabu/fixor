      <p>For decades, the standard for medical device maintenance was simple: follow the manufacturer's recommended PM schedule. Service a device every 6 or 12 months, check the box, and move on.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>But in today's complex healthcare environment, this "one-size-fits-all" model is inefficient and, frankly, outdated. You're wasting valuable technician hours servicing a low-use blood pressure cuff in a storage closet with the same frequency as a critical-care ventilator in the ICU.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>There is a better way. A modern <strong>medical device maintenance strategy</strong> is not based on the calendar; it's based on risk. This is the key to optimizing your team, maximizing uptime on critical assets, and building a defensible compliance program.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>What is a Risk-Based PM Strategy?</h2>
      <p>A risk-based approach, often called an <strong>Alternative Equipment Maintenance (AEM) program</strong>, is a strategy where PM frequency and procedures are based on a device's specific risk profile. The Joint Commission and other regulatory bodies actively encourage AEM programs, provided they are logical, documented, and data-driven.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Instead of treating all assets equally, you classify them. This allows you to focus your most valuable resource—your senior technicians' time—on the equipment that matters most to patient safety.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>The 4 Factors for Calculating Device Risk</h2>
      <p>To build a defensible plan, your risk assessment must be based on objective data. Here are the four key factors to consider for every asset in your inventory.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>1. Equipment Function & Criticality</h3>
      <p>This is the most important factor. Ask these questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the device used for life support (e.g., ventilators, anesthesia machines)?</li>
        <li>Is it used for critical diagnosis or treatment (e.g., defibrillators, surgical lasers)?</li>
        <li>What is the consequence of an unexpected failure?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Result:</strong> Life-support and critical-care devices will always be in your highest PM tier.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>2. Device Usage & Environment</h3>
      <p>A device's location and usage patterns directly impact its failure rate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> An infusion pump used 24/7 in the ICU will wear down faster than an identical pump used once a day in a small clinic.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Is the device in a high-traffic, dusty ER, or a sterile, controlled operating room?</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>3. Service History & Reliability</h3>
      <p>Your own service data is your most powerful tool. Look at the asset's history:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does this specific make and model have a high rate of failure?</li>
        <li>Are you seeing frequent "No Fault Found" on PMs for a certain device type? This may be a sign of over-maintenance.</li>
        <li>Are failures for one device type typically minor (e.g., a broken knob) or critical (e.g., power failure)?</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>4. OEM & Regulatory Minimums</h3>
      <p>You cannot simply ignore manufacturer recommendations. Your risk-based plan must still meet or exceed regulatory minimums. For certain high-risk devices, the OEM's full schedule is non-negotiable.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>How Bravio FSM Enables Your Risk-Based Strategy</h2>
      <p>This all sounds great, but it's impossible to manage on a spreadsheet. A risk-based PM plan requires a system smart enough to handle dynamic scheduling. This is where generic FSMs fail, and <strong>Bravio FSM</strong> excels.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Here is how Bravio makes your advanced strategy a reality:</p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom Asset Classification:</strong> We let you create custom fields for "Risk Level" (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and "AEM Program" on every asset record.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Dynamic PM Schedules:</strong> Our PM engine is not just calendar-based. You can create different, automated PM schedules for each risk tier. High-risk assets automatically get quarterly PMs, while low-risk assets get annual checks.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Bravio's service history reports give you the exact data you need (Factor 3) to justify your risk classifications to an auditor.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Digital Document Storage:</strong> You can attach your written AEM justification documents, OEM manuals, and PM checklists directly to the asset model in Bravio. Everything is in one place, ready for an audit.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Stop Just Servicing. Start Strategizing.</h2>
      <p>A risk-based PM plan is the mark of a mature, efficient, and compliant biomedical service operation. It saves money, optimizes your technicians, and, most importantly, improves patient safety by focusing efforts where they are needed most.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Stop wasting time on low-risk equipment. Start building a smarter maintenance strategy.</p>
