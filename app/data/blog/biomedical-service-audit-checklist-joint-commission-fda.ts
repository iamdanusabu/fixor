      <p>For a biomedical service manager, few phrases cause more stress than "The Joint Commission is here" or "We have an FDA auditor on-site."</p>
      <br/>
      <p>In that moment, your entire documentation system is put to the test. Can you instantly produce a complete service history for any device? Can you prove your technicians' tools were calibrated? Are your parts traceable?</p>
      <br/>
      <p>For teams still relying on spreadsheets, paper binders, and generic FSM software, this is a moment of panic. For teams running <strong>Bravio FSM</strong>, it's just another Tuesday.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Being audit-ready isn't about a last-minute scramble. It's about having compliant processes built into your daily workflow. Use this <strong>biomedical service audit checklist</strong> to see where you stand and how a specialized FSM makes you audit-proof.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>The Ultimate Biomedical Service Audit Checklist</h2>
      <br/>
      
      <h3>Section 1: Asset & Service History Documentation</h3>
      <p>This is the auditor's first stop. They will pick a random device and ask for its entire life story.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Can you pull a complete, chronological service history for any asset by its Unique Device Identification (UDI) or serial number in under 60 seconds?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Does this history include every PM, repair, part installation, and technician note?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Are all service records legible, timestamped, and electronically signed by the technician?</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Bravio's Audit-Ready Solution:</strong> With Bravio FSM, every work order is permanently linked to the asset's UDI. There is no 'other' system. You have a single, searchable, unchangeable audit trail from the moment an asset is onboarded.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>Section 2: Technician & Test Equipment Compliance</h3>
      <p>Auditors must verify that the <em>person</em> and <em>tools</em> performing the service are compliant.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Can you prove the technician who serviced a specific device (e.g., an anesthesia machine) was certified to work on that exact model?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Do you have an active log of all test equipment (multimeters, safety analyzers, etc.) used in the field?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Can you instantly produce a valid calibration certificate for the <em>specific tool</em> used on a <em>specific work order</em> from 6 months ago?</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Bravio's Audit-Ready Solution:</strong> Bravioâ€™s skill-based dispatching won't even assign a job to an uncertified tech. More importantly, it integrates test equipment calibration. If a tech's tool is out of cert, the system can block them from closing the work order, eliminating compliance risk at the source.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>Section 3: Inventory & Parts Traceability</h3>
      <p>This is a critical patient safety area. If a part is recalled, you must be able to trace it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> When you install a part, do you record its lot number and expiration date?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> If a manufacturer issues a recall for a specific lot, can you produce a list of all devices that received that part?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Can you prove that no expired parts (like batteries or sensors) were ever installed in a device?</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>Bravio's Audit-Ready Solution:</strong> We built lot number and expiration date tracking into our core inventory module. When a part is used, it's scanned and linked to the work order and asset. A recall search that takes you days of digging in binders takes 10 seconds in Bravio.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h3>Section 4: Preventive Maintenance (PM) Adherence</h3>
      <p>Auditors need to see that you are proactively maintaining equipment according to OEM standards, not just fixing it when it breaks.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Can you provide a report showing your PM completion rate for the last 12 months?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Are your PM procedures standardized using digital checklists based on OEM requirements?</li>
        <li><strong>Checklist Item:</strong> Can you prove that PMs were scheduled, completed, and documented on time, every time?</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>BBravio's Audit-Ready Solution:</strong> Bravio automates your entire PM schedule. It generates work orders automatically, attaches the correct digital checklist, and tracks completion rates on your dashboard. You can show an auditor your 99% PM adherence rate with a single click.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Stop Dreading Audits. Start Acing Them.</h2>
      <p>How did you score on that checklist? If you felt a pit in your stomach just reading the questions, it's time for a new system.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Generic FSM software doesn't understand UDI, calibration tracking, or lot traceability. <strong>Bravio FSM</strong> was built for it. We designed our platform to turn this audit checklist into your simple, automated, everyday workflow.</p>
