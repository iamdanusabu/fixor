      <p>If you're reading this, you already know the difference between a generic Field Service Management (FSM) platform and a specialized one. You've likely suffered through a system built for HVAC or plumbing, struggling to force it to handle your complex compliance and inventory needs.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>That compromise ends here. <strong>Bravio FSM</strong> was not adapted for the biomedical industry—it was built for it. Every feature is designed to automate the painful, high-stakes tasks unique to servicing medical equipment.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Here are the 5 core features that make <strong>Bravio for biomedical</strong> the only platform that truly meets your compliance, inventory, and scheduling demands.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>1. Guaranteed Audit Trails: UDI and Service History</h2>
      <p>Generic FSM software uses a simple "asset tag" field. We use the <strong>Unique Device Identification (UDI)</strong> standard. With Bravio, every single work order, PM checklist, and installed part is automatically and permanently linked to the serialized asset.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>What this means for you:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>One-Click Audits:</strong> Pull a complete, chronological service history for any device in seconds, ready for FDA or Joint Commission review.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance Enforcement:</strong> Techs must verify UDI and complete compliance checklists before they can close a job.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>2. Integrated Calibration Tracking</h2>
      <p>This is a critical compliance blind spot for most FSMs. If your tech's multimeter is out of date, every service record they create is compromised.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Bravio integrates your test equipment into your workflow:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Calibration Alarms:</strong> Automated alerts notify technicians and managers before a tool's certificate expires.</li>
          <li><strong>Work Order Linking:</strong> Techs must log the calibrated equipment used on a job. If a tool is out of certification, Bravio <em>prevents</em> the work order from being closed.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>3. Smart Inventory with Lot Number Traceability</h2>
      <p>Your inventory is not just generic stock; it's high-value, expiration-sensitive, and traceable material. While a typical FSM only tracks quantity, <strong>Bravio FSM</strong> tracks compliance data for every single part.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Our system tracks:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Lot Numbers and Expiration Dates:</strong> Instantly locate every device that received a part from a recalled lot.</li>
          <li><strong>Van Stock Accuracy:</strong> Real-time updates ensure your inventory records are correct, minimizing wasted trips and preventing the use of expired components.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>4. Priority and Skill-Based Dispatching</h2>
      <p>The "closest tech" logic fails when a critical ventilator needs a Level 3 certified technician. Bravio’s scheduling engine prioritizes safety and compliance over mere proximity.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>The system automatically matches:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Certifications to Jobs:</strong> Ensures only techs with the right skills (e.g., "Anesthesia Machine Certified") are assigned complex repairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Criticality Tiers:</strong> Prioritizes emergency repairs (P1) over routine PMs, ensuring your most critical clients get the fastest response.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>5. Automated PM Scheduling and Renewal</h2>
      <p>Preventive Maintenance (PM) is your most profitable revenue stream, but managing thousands of PM deadlines on a spreadsheet is nearly impossible.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Bravio automates PM contracts from start to finish:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Auto-Generation:</strong> Automatically queues PM work orders 30-60 days before the due date, ensuring you never miss a revenue opportunity or contract deadline.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Checklists:</strong> Guides technicians through standardized, compliant PM procedures based on OEM requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>The Choice is Clear: Specialized or Generic?</h2>
      <p>In the biomedical service industry, compromise leads to compliance risk, financial loss, and inefficiency. You need a platform that elevates your service, not complicates it.</p>
      <br/>
