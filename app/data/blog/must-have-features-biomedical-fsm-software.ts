    <p>Running a biomedical service company is all about precision, compliance, and safety. The stakes are high, and your customers (and auditors) expect perfection.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>So why are so many service companies trying to manage their complex operations with generic FSM software built for plumbers and electricians? While generic tools can schedule a job, they lack the critical, non-negotiable features your biomedical team needs.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>If you're shopping for a new <strong>medical equipment service software</strong>, don't even <em>consider</em> a platform unless it has these five features built-in, not bolted on.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>1. Built-in UDI & Audit-Ready Compliance</h2>
    <p>This is the number one failure of generic software. For you, compliance isn't just a checkbox; it's your license to operate. A "custom notes field" is not an audit trail.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Your FSM <em>must</em> have dedicated, out-of-the-box fields for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unique Device Identification (UDI)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Device Risk Levels (High, Medium, Low)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Preventive Maintenance (PM) Protocols</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Links to OEM Manuals and Procedures</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When an auditor arrives, you should be able to pull a complete, audit-ready service history for any device in seconds. If you can't, the software has failed you.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>2. Traceable Inventory (Lot Numbers & Expiration)</h2>
    <p>A generic FSM sees "10 batteries." You need to see "10 batteries, <strong>Lot Number 45A-882</strong>, <strong>Expires 06/2027</strong>."</p>
    <br/>
    <p>If a manufacturer issues a recall on a specific lot of parts, you must be able to instantly identify every patient-facing device where that part was used. This is impossible with generic inventory. Your software must track serial numbers, lot numbers, and expiration dates for critical components from the moment they enter your stock to the moment they are installed.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>3. Integrated Test Equipment Calibration Tracking</h2>
    <p>Your service is only as good as your tools. If a technician services a defibrillator with an uncalibrated multimeter, that service is invalid and the device's safety is compromised.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Your FSM software should track your technicians' test equipment alongside their skills. It should:
    <ul>
        <li>Store calibration certificates for every tool.</li>
        <li>Send alerts to admins (and techs) before a tool's calibration expires.</li>
        <li>Ideally, prevent a tech from closing a work order if their test equipment is out of calibration.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>4. Skill-Based & Criticality-Aware Scheduling</h2>
    <p>Generic FSMs dispatch based on one rule: "who is closest." This is a disaster for biomedical service. You can't send your newest Level 1 tech to service a complex MRI machine, even if they're in the next room.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>A true <strong>biomedical FSM software</strong> understands complex scheduling. It allows you to dispatch based on:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technician Skill:</strong> Matching the tech's certifications (e.g., "MRI Certified," "Anesthesia Level 3") to the job requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Criticality:</strong> Prioritizing an "ER Defibrillator Down" emergency over a "Routine PM" on a vitals monitor.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>5. Complete, Unified Asset Service History</h2>
    <p>Your customers (hospitals and clinics) are also subject to audits. They need a complete service history for every single device they own. Your software must be able to provide this instantly.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>This means every work order, every PM check, every part used, and every compliance note must be permanently tied to a specific, serialized asset in the system. When your customer asks for the history of "Infusion Pump, S/N 12345," your software should produce a clean, professional report in one click. This proves your value and makes you an indispensable partner.</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Stop Compromising. Get the Right FSM.</h2>
    <p>You can't "customize" a generic FSM to do these things properly. You'll spend months building a fragile system of custom fields that still fails at reporting.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>You need a tool that was built for the biomedical industry from day one. <strong>Bravio</strong> was designed with these 5 features at its core. We handle the complex compliance, inventory, and scheduling so you can focus on providing critical, life-saving service.</p>
