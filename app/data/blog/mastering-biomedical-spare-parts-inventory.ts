      <p>Your technician is on-site at a hospital, 45 minutes from the office. They've diagnosed a faulty controller on a critical patient monitor. They open their van, search through the bins, and... the part isn't there. Now you have to pay for a second trip, the client's equipment stays down longer, and your profit on the job is gone.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>This is the inventory nightmare. For small and medium-sized biomedical service companies, inventory isn't just a list; it's the lifeblood of your business. Managing it from a spreadsheet or a generic FSM is a recipe for chaos.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Why Biomedical Inventory is (Much) Harder</h2>
      <p>Unlike plumbing or HVAC, <strong>biomedical parts inventory management</strong> has unique challenges that generic software can't handle:</p>
      <br/>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Traceability is Non-Negotiable:</strong> You can't just track "one battery." You must track "one battery, <strong>Lot Number 45A-882</strong>." If that lot is recalled, you must know every device it was installed in. Generic systems can't do this.</li>
          <li><strong>Parts Have Expiration Dates:</strong> Sterile components, reagents, and even batteries have a shelf life. Using an expired part is a massive compliance risk. A spreadsheet can't alert you when stock is about to expire.</li>
          <li><strong>Your Vans are Mini-Warehouses:</strong> Your "warehouse" isn't just one building; it's five vans moving around the city. Tracking who has what (and if it's been used) is a full-time job without the right system.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>The Real Cost of "Inventory Chaos"</h2>
      <p>Poor inventory management isn't just an annoyance; it's a direct financial drain. The "chaos" costs you in three major ways:</p>
      <br/>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Wasted Labor & Fuel:</strong> The "second trip" scenario is the most obvious cost. You are paying a highly-skilled technician to be a delivery driver, all for a part that should have been on the van.</li>
          <li><strong>Wasted Stock & Capital:</strong> Every expired, untracked part you have to throw away is money down the drain. This also includes "lost" parts that are sitting in a tech's van, unused, while you order more of the same.</li>
          <li><strong>Lost Client Trust:</strong> When a critical device is down, your client (the hospital or clinic) is losing money and capability. Making them wait for a part erodes their confidence in your service.</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>How to Move from Chaos to Control</h2>
      <p>You can't fix this problem with a better spreadsheet. You need a single source of truthâ€”a true <strong>FSM software with inventory</strong> built for your needs.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>1. Centralize Your Stock:</strong> Get everything into one system. Your FSM should show you every part you own, whether it's in the main warehouse or in Van #3, along with its lot number and expiration date.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>2. Connect Inventory to Work Orders:</strong> The system should be smart. When a tech is assigned a PM for an "Infusion Pump Model X," the work order should automatically list the required filter and battery, allowing the tech to confirm they have it <em>before</em> they leave.</p>
      <br/>
      <p><strong>3. Manage Van Stock Like a Pro:</strong> Your FSM's mobile app should allow techs to log parts as they are used. This instantly deducts the part from their van's inventory and adds it to the work order for billing, keeping your stock levels accurate in real-time.</p>
      <br/>
  
      <h2>Don't Just Manage Inventory. Master It.</h2>
      <p>This level of control isn't a "nice to have"; it's essential for profitability and compliance in the biomedical field. <strong>Bravio</strong> was built with this traceable, high-stakes inventory management at its core.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>We handle the lot numbers, expiration dates, and van stock tracking so you can stop wasting money on return trips and expired parts. </p>
